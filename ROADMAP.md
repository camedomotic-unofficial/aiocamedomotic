# Development roadmap

## Introduction

This document outlines the planned development path for this library. The roadmap
reflects our commitment to making home automation more accessible and manageable.

This roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and ongoing development
insights. We look forward to growing this library together with our users and contributors.

## Current Features (Version 1.1)

- **Session management**: Automated handling of login and logout processes for the API.
- **Lights management**: List and set the status of lights in the domotic environment.
- **Openings management**: Control and monitor shutters, including listing and setting
their status.

## Planned Features

### Short-term goals (Versions 1.2 to 1.3)

- **Scenarios management**: Support for listing available scenarios and triggering them.

- **Thermoregulation management**:
  - List thermo zones within the domotic environment.
  - Retrieve current temperature readings.
  - Get and set thermoregulation configurations.

### Mid-term goals (Version 1.4)

- **Energy reporting**:
  - Retrieve instant and historical energy consumption reports, aiding in monitoring
    and optimizing energy usage.

### Long-term goals (Version 1.5 and beyond)

- **Loads control**:
  - Integrate features to monitor current energy consumption.
  - Provide capabilities to get and set configuration for managing loads effectively.
- **User management**:
  - Implement functionality to list users defined on the remote server, enhancing
    control over who has access to the domotic plant management.
- **Digital-in**:
  - Implement functionalities to list and acts on the digital-ins (e.g. digital switches)
- **Terminals**: Implement functionality to list the configured terminals (i.e. CAME Domotic servers)

## Future considerations

As our library evolves, we are open to exploring additional functionalities that can
enhance domotic plant management.
